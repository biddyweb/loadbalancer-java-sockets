# Introduction #

This project is more of a proof of concept, which was visualized to help those who participate to learn and share knowledge about the load balancing of servers. Currently, the project is not scoped and therefore; it may be possible to increase the scope going forward.
We would love other developers to participate in this project and give their valuable inputs. As we are new to open source development, as well as development itself; it would be highly appreciated if we are provided with more appropriate guidance in this regards.
